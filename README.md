# santander-predictions

Binary classification with a (simple) Deep Neural Network - built in R via Keras (TensorFlow).

Financial data (2D tensors) from Kaggle Competition. 

I display a simple playbook of how to approach any machine learning problem, and do not focus on fine-tuning my model.

Output is displayed in the file 'notebook.pdf', which is a knit of 'notebook.Rmd'.
